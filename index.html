        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This website is the product of a personal project I've embarked on in order to teach myself how to code.
            I'd like to give a big thanks to Morgan Haworth for teaching me and starting me on this journey.
            The current character sheet is set up in reference to the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons which is owned by Wizards of the Coast.
            It is also inspired by D&D Beyond, a website also owned and operated by Wizards of the Coast.
            However, all coding has been created from scratch by me: Jessica Steckelberg.
            This website is by no means created for profit and is intended for use by me and my friends to easily create character sheet for our own home games.
            That being said, please enjoy! 
        </p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            You will be given a form to fill out which will guide you through selections to make in order to create your d&d character.
            It will ask you your class, race, background, and any other options in order to fill out your character sheet.
            At the end you will be able to download a pdf of the character sheet for home use.
